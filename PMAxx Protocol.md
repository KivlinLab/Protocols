# PMAxxx Protocol

(1)	Suspend 250mg of soil in 1000 ul of CTAB buffer. Create two reps for each sample (one will receive PMAxx and one won't).

(2)	Add enough PMAxx to half of the samples to create a final solution of 40 uM in a dark room. (dilute 20mM stock to 2mM by adding sterile water 1:10; then add 20ul of 2mM to each tube)

(3)	Vortex for 4 minutes in the dark at room temperature.

(4)	Expose samples to 30 second of light with lamp and 30 seconds of darkness 4 times while continually vortexing.

(5)	Store extracts frozen.
