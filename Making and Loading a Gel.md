How to make and Load a Gel

(1)	Weigh 1g of agarose and add to a 250ml flask

(2)	Add 100ml of 1% TAE buffer to the flask (this makes a 1% gel)

(3)	Microwave the flask for 1:30 minutes. Make sure that the solution does not overflow.

(4)	Let the solution cool on the bench until it is warm to the touch.

(5)	Add 10ul of sybr safe stain and mix (wear gloves!)

(6)	Pour the gel into the gel rig and use the combs to remove any bubbles

(7)	Add the combs to the gel

(8)	Let it set for at least 20 minutes or until hard. Make sure the gel is covered in foil or in the dark for this step.

(9)	Turn the gel and add enough 1% TAE to the gel rig to cover the gel

(10)	Add your samples by combining 5ul of DNA with 2ul of loading dye.

(11)	Add the ladder to the first lane of each row by combining 2ul of the ladder with 2ul of dye. If ladder comes mixed with loading dye 
(it is not clear), then just add 2ul of the ladder.

(12)	For normal PCR products or DNA extracts run the gel at 150v for at least 30 minutes

(13)	For restriction digests run the gel at the lowest voltage for at least 4 hours
